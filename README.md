How to Play the Game

The goal of the game is to move your character across the game board to the water while avoiding the bugs.
Use the keypad to move the character. Every time you move your character into the water, you move to the next
level.
Once you get through all 10 levels, you win the game.
If your character and an enemy bug occupy the same space, your character will be moved back to the starting square
and you will lose a life.
If you lose all 3 lives, you lose the game and have to start over from level 1.
As you progress through the levels, the number of bugs on the screen will increase,
and the speeds the bugs move at change to increase difficulty.
